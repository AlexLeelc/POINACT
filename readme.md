This project is for personal learning purposes only.

The project only provides one demo, based on personal device implementation and designed using PyTorch, PyQt, and Python 3.9.

Poinact.py represents the process of model training and optimization.

PointNet.py represents the core part of PointNet.

PointNet_lstm.py represents the improvement of PointNet by introducing LSTM layer.

testmatrix.py represents the code for drawing a confusion matrix.

TimeDistributed.py represents the preprocessing of the LSTM input.

traindataprocess.py represents the process of preprocessing input data.

v1.py represents the integration of PyQt.

dataset.zip represents the dataset.(RADHAR dataset is used)
